# Simple fee explanation

Fundbit does not intend to profit from failed bounties. We only charge a 5% fee on
successful bounties which is used to cover the cost of running the platform and to fund
future development.

### Why does Fundbit refund slightly less than the full amount?

Every contribution incurs a transaction processing fee that must be paid to
Stripe. Refunded transactions also incur an additional fee of an undetermined amount
(again, set by Stripe / the payment processor). These fees are not refundable, and if
your contribution is refunded, you will notice the refunded amount is less than the
amount you contributed.

Typically, Stripe fees are 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction, but this can vary based on
the country you are in, the type of card you use, and other factors.

As the refund fee is not fixed nor determinable before the refund happens, we have will likely
have to charge an additional fee to cover it in the future. Right now, Fundbit covers
this cost. If you work at Stripe and see this and want to help us out, please reach out!

### How are fees calculated exactly?

You can see the latest source code for the fee calculation on
<a href="https://github.com/jckw/fundbit">GitHub</a>. We aim to be as transparent as
possible with our fee structure.
